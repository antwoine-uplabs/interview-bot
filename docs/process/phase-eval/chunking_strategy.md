# Optimal Chunking and Retrieval Strategy for Interview Evaluation

## Analysis of Conversation Structure

Interview transcripts have a unique structure that requires specialized chunking and retrieval approaches:

1. **Turn-based dialogue** - Alternating between interviewer questions and candidate responses
2. **Topical segments** - Each question-answer pair typically covers a distinct technical topic
3. **Context continuity** - Later answers may reference earlier statements
4. **Variable response lengths** - Some answers are brief while others are detailed explanations
5. **Structured components** - May contain code blocks, lists, or technical explanations

## Recommended Approach

### Chunking Strategy

For the AI Interview Evaluator, our optimal chunking approach is **Dialogue-Aware Semantic Chunking**:

1. **Primary chunking unit: Q&A pairs**
   - Each interviewer question + candidate response forms a natural semantic unit
   - Preserves the complete context of each technical assessment
   - Maintains the dialogue flow and question framing

2. **Metadata enrichment**
   - Tag each chunk with technical topic identifiers (e.g., "Python", "SQL", "Statistics")
   - Extract technical terms and concepts for improved retrieval
   - Include position in interview sequence for temporal context

3. **Overlap strategy**
   - Include previous question context for multi-part questions
   - Maintain references to previously mentioned skills or examples

### Retrieval Strategy

Our retrieval approach employs a multi-stage process optimized for interview evaluation:

1. **Hybrid semantic + keyword search**
   - Combine dense vector embeddings for semantic matching
   - Use BM25 or similar sparse retrieval for technical terminology
   - Weight retrieval towards specific technical topics during criteria evaluation

2. **Hierarchical retrieval**
   - First retrieve relevant topic sections (Python, SQL, etc.)
   - Then retrieve specific technical concepts within those sections

3. **Evaluation-focused re-ranking**
   - Re-rank retrieved chunks based on evaluation criteria relevance
   - Prioritize chunks that demonstrate skill application over theoretical knowledge
   - Use citation prediction to identify most representative examples

## Implementation Plan

For our LlamaIndex implementation:

1. Use `SentenceSplitter` with `separator="\n\n"` to respect paragraph boundaries
2. Implement a custom `DialogueNodeParser` that creates chunks based on interviewer-candidate exchanges
3. Add metadata extraction to enhance retrieval performance
4. Implement a custom retriever that uses a hybrid approach with re-ranking
5. Fine-tune chunk sizes based on empirical performance in evaluation accuracy

This approach is optimal because it:
- Preserves the natural dialogue structure of interviews
- Maintains the semantic integrity of Q&A exchanges
- Enables targeted evaluation of specific technical competencies
- Facilitates accurate citation of evidence for evaluation criteria
- Optimizes for the specific needs of skill assessment rather than general QA
