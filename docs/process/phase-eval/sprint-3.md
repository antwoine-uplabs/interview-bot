# Sprint 3: End-to-End Workflow & API

**Goal**: Connect the LangGraph agent's output to Supabase storage via the FastAPI backend, develop the necessary API endpoints, and integrate the frontend for transcript upload.

**Dates**: July 27, 2024 - August 10, 2024

## Tasks

### Component: Agent-DB Integration
- [x] Implement a final node or step in the LangGraph agent to format the evaluation results and summary.
- [x] Implement utility functions/service in the backend to interact with Supabase tables (`evaluation_results`, `evaluation_summaries`, `interviews`).
- [x] Connect the LangGraph agent's output: Save individual results and the final summary to the corresponding Supabase tables.
- [x] Update the `interviews` table status (e.g., 'processing', 'evaluated', 'error') during the workflow.
- [x] Ensure proper handling of foreign key relationships when saving data.

### Component: Backend API Endpoints (FastAPI)
- [x] Refine the `/upload` endpoint:
    - Accept file upload.
    - Save transcript metadata to the `interviews` table with 'uploaded' status.
    - Store the transcript (e.g., in Supabase Storage or directly in the table if small).
    - *Asynchronously* trigger the LangGraph evaluation process (e.g., using FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` or a task queue like Celery/RQ for longer processes).
    - Return the `interview_id` and initial status.
- [x] Implement a `/evaluate` endpoint that accepts an interview_id and returns results.
- [x] Implement a `/status/{interview_id}` endpoint to check the evaluation progress.
- [x] Implement a `/results/{interview_id}` endpoint to fetch the formatted evaluation results and summary from Supabase once processing is complete.
- [x] Add basic API authentication/authorization (e.g., requiring a valid Supabase JWT).
- [x] Implement request validation (Pydantic models) for endpoint inputs.
- [x] Improve error handling and logging for API endpoints.

### Component: Frontend Upload Integration
- [x] Connect the file input component (from Sprint 1) to the backend `/upload` API endpoint.
- [x] Handle the API response (getting the `interview_id`).
- [x] Implement UI feedback during upload (e.g., loading indicator).
- [x] Implement polling mechanism to check evaluation status.
- [x] Update the UI to indicate when processing is complete.
- [x] Display evaluation results fetched from API.
- [x] Add support for displaying strengths, weaknesses, and supporting quotes.
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling for API failures.

## Completed Work

1. **Frontend API Integration**
   - Connected file upload component to backend `/upload` API endpoint

   - Created polling mechanism to check evaluation status
   - Updated UI to indicate when processing is complete
   - Enhanced evaluation results display component
   - Added support for strengths and weaknesses section
   - Implemented supporting quotes display for each criterion
   - Added comprehensive error handling for API failures

2. **Backend API Development**
   - Refined `/upload` endpoint for transcript files

## Notes

- Successfully implemented end-to-end workflow from transcript upload to results retrieval
- Asynchronous processing of the evaluation works well with polling from the frontend
- Comprehensive error handling on both frontend and backend ensures robust application behavior
- Created full integration with Supabase for storing evaluation results with proper database schema
- Added JWT-based authentication for all API endpoints
- Further improvements could include WebSocket support for real-time status updates
- Next sprint will focus on visualization components and enhanced user management
