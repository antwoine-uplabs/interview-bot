## Notes

- Focus on creating intuitive, user-friendly visualizations that highlight key insights
- Build on the existing JWT authentication backend implemented in Sprint 3
- The comparative evaluation feature should support both qualitative and quantitative comparisons
- Consider implementing CSV export functionality for integration with other HR systems
- All UI components should be accessible and responsive
- Use the already created Supabase tables and schema from Sprint 3
- Leverage existing API endpoints for status and results when building the visualization components
