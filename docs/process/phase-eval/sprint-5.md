## Implementation Notes

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflows have been configured for both frontend and backend
- Automated testing runs on every PR and push to main
- Production deployment requires manual approval
- Notifications are sent to Slack for build/test failures

### Testing Framework
- Frontend testing uses Vitest and React Testing Library
- Backend testing uses pytest with coverage reporting
- Mocking is implemented for Supabase, OpenAI, and LangSmith
- Test fixtures cover common test scenarios
- End-to-end tests validate critical user workflows

### Deployment
- Backend is containerized with Docker and multi-stage builds
- Frontend is deployed to Vercel with automatic previews for PRs
- Environment variables are properly configured for different environments
- Security hardening includes rate limiting, CORS, and content security policy
- Backup and recovery processes are documented

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Sentry is implemented for both frontend and backend error tracking
- LangSmith monitors all LLM calls with detailed tracing
- Performance monitoring dashboards show API usage and response times
- User analytics track feature usage patterns
- Still need to implement alerting and cost monitoring

### Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation includes:
  - API documentation with detailed endpoints
  - Deployment guides for different environments
  - Security considerations and best practices
  - Developer onboarding materials
  - User guides for the application

## Next Steps
- Implement alerting for critical failures
- Create cost monitoring for LLM API usage
- Conduct user acceptance testing
- Final verification of CI/CD pipeline
