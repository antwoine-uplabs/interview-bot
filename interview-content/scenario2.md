## Detailed Interview Script & Questions

### 1. Introduction & Scenario Presentation (5 min)

**Script for Interviewer:**

"Welcome! Today, we'll discuss a product launch experimentation scenario. A B2B SaaS company is planning to launch a significant redesign of their core product interface. Before rolling out to all customers, they want to conduct a rigorous experimental evaluation to ensure the new design improves key metrics without negatively impacting customer workflows or satisfaction. The company has customers ranging from small businesses to enterprise clients, each with different usage patterns and needs. Key challenges include designing a statistically valid experiment with complex business constraints, determining appropriate sample sizes across heterogeneous customer segments, selecting and prioritizing metrics that balance business goals, accounting for novelty effects and learning curves, minimizing business risk while maximizing learning, and creating a clear decision framework for go/no-go based on experimental results."

### 2. Candidate Restatement & Clarification (5 min)

**Initial Question:**
"To ensure we're on the same page, could you restate the problem as you understand it and highlight what you see as the key challenges from a data science perspective?"

**Possible Follow-Up Questions:**

- "What additional information would be helpful for you to better understand this scenario?"
- "Are there any aspects of this scenario you'd like me to clarify?"

**Example Prompts:**

- If candidate misses key constraints: "What about the challenge of accounting for different customer types and their varying usage patterns?"
- If candidate seeks clarification: "The company has approximately 5,000 customers across various industries and sizes. About 70% are small businesses with 5-50 employees, 20% are mid-market companies with 51-500 employees, and 10% are enterprise customers with 500+ employees. The redesign introduces new navigation paradigms and feature groupings but doesn't add new functionality."

### 3. Problem Framing & Approach (15 min)

**Primary Questions:**

- "How would you frame this as an experimental design problem? What would your high-level approach be?"
- "What experimental methodology would you propose, and why?"
- "How would you balance statistical rigor with business constraints and risks?"

**Follow-Up Questions:**

- "What assumptions would you make in designing this experiment?"
- "What trade-offs do you anticipate making with your proposed approach?"
- "How would you account for the heterogeneity in the customer base?"

**Example Prompts:**

- If candidate gives vague answers: "Could you be more specific about the experimental design you would use? Would you use A/B testing, a multi-arm bandit, or another approach?"
- If candidate focuses only on methodology: "How would you ensure that your approach addresses the business's need to minimize risk to enterprise customers?"
- If candidate gives a strong answer: "That's interesting. Could you elaborate on how you would determine the appropriate exposure duration for the experiment?"

### 4. Technical Deep Dive (20 min)

### A. Experimental Design and Methodology

**Questions:**

- "What specific experimental design would you use for this product launch evaluation? Walk me through your reasoning."
- "How would you handle control and treatment group assignments for different customer segments?"
- "What approach would you take to mitigate potential biases in your experiment?"

**Example Prompts:**

- "What are the pros and cons of your chosen experimental design compared to alternatives?"
- "How would you handle potential contamination between test and control groups?"

### B. Sample Size Determination and Customer Segmentation

**Questions:**

- "How would you determine the appropriate sample size for your experiment?"
- "What approach would you use to segment customers for stratified sampling, if applicable?"
- "How would you ensure adequate representation of different customer types?"

**Example Prompts:**

- "How would you handle power calculations for multiple metrics with different expected effect sizes?"
- "What techniques would you use if enterprise customers are too few for traditional significance testing?"

### C. Metrics Selection and Analysis Plan

**Questions:**

- "What metrics would you select to evaluate the success of the new interface, and why?"
- "How would you prioritize potentially conflicting metrics?"
- "What statistical methods would you use to analyze the experimental results?"

**Example Prompts:**

- "How would you incorporate both short-term usage metrics and longer-term business outcomes?"
- "What techniques would you use to account for learning curves or novelty effects in your analysis?"

### D. Statistical Power and Sensitivity Considerations

**Questions:**

- "How would you approach statistical power analysis for this experiment?"
- "What minimum detectable effect sizes would you target and why?"
- "How would you handle multiple hypothesis testing in your analysis?"

**Example Prompts:**

- "How would you balance Type I and Type II errors in this business context?"
- "What approach would you take if you can't achieve desired power for all customer segments?"

### E. Results Interpretation and Decision Framework

**Questions:**

- "How would you structure a decision framework based on experimental results?"
- "What would be your approach to interpreting mixed or inconclusive results?"
- "How would you communicate experimental findings and recommendations to stakeholders?"

**Example Prompts:**

- "How would you handle a situation where results are positive for some customer segments but negative for others?"
- "What visualizations would you create to help stakeholders understand statistical significance and practical impact?"

### 5. Scenario Adaptation (10 min)

**Scenario Changes:**

"Let's introduce a change to our requirements. The product team has just informed you that they have a hard deadline to launch in 6 weeks, which limits your experiment duration. Additionally, certain enterprise customers have contractual guarantees about interface stability that would prevent them from being included in the experiment without special approval processes."

**Questions:**

- "How would you adapt your experimental approach given these new constraints?"
- "What compromises might you need to make in your design, and how would you mitigate the risks?"
- "How would you handle the exclusion of enterprise customers from the experiment?"

**Example Prompts:**

- "How would your sample size and power calculations change with the shortened timeline?"
- "What alternative approaches might you suggest if a full experiment isn't possible within constraints?"

### 6. Problem-Solving Discussion (5 min)

**Scenario:**

"Imagine your experiment has been running for two weeks of a planned four-week test. Initial results show a concerning pattern: engagement metrics are down significantly in the first few days for users in the treatment group, but then gradually improve and eventually surpass the control group by the end of the first week. However, a small subset of users (~5%) show consistently worse metrics throughout the two weeks."

**Questions:**

- "How would you interpret these preliminary results?"
- "What additional analyses would you conduct to better understand these patterns?"
- "What recommendations would you make to the product team at this point?"

**Example Prompts:**

- "How would you determine if the initial drop is due to a learning curve or a fundamental issue?"
- "What characteristics might you analyze about the 5% of users with consistently worse metrics?"

### 7. Wrap-Up (5 min)

**Questions for Candidate:**

- "Do you have any questions about our team or the role?"
- "Is there anything about this scenario that you would approach differently if you had more time to discuss it?"

**Closing Script:**

"Thank you for walking us through your approach to this product launch experimentation problem. We appreciate your insights and the time you've spent with us today. Our team will be reviewing all candidate interviews and will be in touch about next steps within [timeframe]."
