## Detailed Interview Script & Questions

### 1. Introduction & Scenario Presentation (5 min)

**Script for Interviewer:**

"Welcome! Today, we'll discuss a customer retention scenario focusing on causal inference. A subscription-based streaming service wants to understand what factors truly cause customer churn and design targeted interventions to improve retention. They have detailed user interaction data, content viewing history, customer service interactions, billing data, and limited demographic information. The business needs to move beyond correlation to identify causal factors they can influence. Key challenges include distinguishing correlation from causation in observational data, isolating the effects of multiple potential causal factors, quantifying the likely impact of proposed interventions before implementation, addressing selection bias and unobserved confounding variables, developing intervention strategies that balance effectiveness with cost, and creating a framework for ongoing causal learning and intervention refinement."

### 2. Candidate Restatement & Clarification (5 min)

- "Are there any aspects of this scenario you'd like me to clarify?"

**Example Prompts:**

- If candidate misses key constraints: "What about the challenge of addressing unobserved confounding variables in observational data?"
- If candidate seeks clarification: "The streaming service has approximately 2 million subscribers with about 15% annual churn rate. They have 18 months of detailed user data including viewing patterns, device usage, payment history, and customer service interactions. They can implement interventions like content recommendations, price incentives, service upgrades, or targeted communications."

### 3. Problem Framing & Approach (15 min)

**Primary Questions:**

- "How would you frame this as a causal inference problem? What would your high-level approach be?"
- "What methodologies would you consider for identifying causal drivers of churn?"
- "How would you approach the design and evaluation of potential interventions?"

**Follow-Up Questions:**

- "What assumptions would you make in your causal analysis?"
- "What trade-offs do you anticipate making with your proposed approach?"
- "How would you prioritize which potential causal factors to investigate first?"

**Example Prompts:**

- If candidate gives vague answers: "Could you be more specific about the causal inference techniques you would use? Would you use propensity scoring, instrumental variables, or another approach?"
- If candidate focuses only on methodology: "How would you ensure that your approach leads to actionable insights for the business?"
- If candidate gives a strong answer: "That's interesting. Could you elaborate on how you would validate the causal relationships you identify?"

### 4. Technical Deep Dive (20 min)

### A. Causal Inference Methodology

**Questions:**

- "What specific causal inference methodologies would you use for this problem? Walk me through your reasoning."

- "What approach would you take to identify the most promising causal factors to investigate?"

**Example Prompts:**

- "What are the pros and cons of your chosen causal inference approach compared to alternatives?"
- "How would you incorporate domain knowledge into your causal modeling?"

### B. Confounding and Bias Mitigation

**Questions:**

- "How would you identify and address potential confounding variables?"
- "What techniques would you use to mitigate selection bias in your analysis?"
- "How would you handle unobserved confounders that might affect your causal estimates?"

**Example Prompts:**

- "How would you determine if you've adequately controlled for confounding?"
- "What sensitivity analyses would you perform to assess the robustness of your causal claims?"

### C. Intervention Effect Estimation

**Questions:**

- "How would you estimate the potential effect of interventions before implementing them?"
- "What approach would you take to predict heterogeneous treatment effects across different customer segments?"
- "How would you quantify uncertainty in your causal effect estimates?"

**Example Prompts:**

- "How would you prioritize multiple possible interventions based on their estimated effects?"
- "What techniques would you use to estimate the cost-effectiveness of different interventions?"

### D. Testing Framework and Validation

**Questions:**

- "How would you design an intervention testing framework to validate your causal hypotheses?"
- "What would your approach be for incrementally rolling out and evaluating interventions?"
- "How would you ensure that your causal findings generalize beyond your initial analysis?"

**Example Prompts:**

- "What experimental designs would you consider to validate your causal findings?"
- "How would you handle the trade-off between testing multiple interventions and obtaining clear causal signals?"

### E. Implementation and Monitoring Strategy

**Questions:**

- "How would you translate your causal findings into an actionable intervention strategy?"
- "What would your approach be for monitoring the effectiveness of interventions over time?"
- "How would you implement a system for ongoing causal learning and intervention refinement?"

**Example Prompts:**

- "How would you detect if a previously effective intervention starts losing its impact?"
- "What feedback loops would you establish between intervention implementation and causal analysis?"

### 5. Scenario Adaptation (10 min)

**Scenario Changes:**

"Let's introduce a change to our requirements. The streaming service has just launched in three new international markets where they have very limited historical data. Additionally, they're under pressure to show retention improvements within the next quarter, rather than waiting for long-term results."

**Questions:**

- "How would you adapt your causal inference approach given these new constraints?"
- "What modifications would you make to your intervention strategy given the timeline pressure?"
- "How would you handle the lack of historical data in the new markets?"

**Example Prompts:**

- "What transfer learning approaches might you consider for the new markets?"
- "How would you balance the need for quick results with the requirement for causal understanding?"

### 6. Problem-Solving Discussion (5 min)

**Scenario:**

"Imagine you've implemented a set of interventions based on your causal analysis. Most are showing positive effects, but one intervention (offering a discounted annual subscription to users with declining engagement) is showing mixed results - it's very effective for newer subscribers but seems to actually accelerate churn for long-term customers when they reach the end of the discounted period."

**Questions:**

- "How would you investigate this unexpected pattern?"
- "What might explain this heterogeneous treatment effect?"
- "How would you revise your intervention strategy based on this finding?"

**Example Prompts:**

- "What additional data would you analyze to understand this differential response?"
- "How would you design a follow-up intervention to address the negative effect on long-term customers?"

### 7. Wrap-Up (5 min)

**Questions for Candidate:**

- "Do you have any questions about our team or the role?"
- "Is there anything about this scenario that you would approach differently if you had more time to discuss it?"

**Closing Script:**

"Thank you for walking us through your approach to this customer retention causal inference problem. We appreciate your insights and the time you've spent with us today. Our team will be reviewing all candidate interviews and will be in touch about next steps within [timeframe]."
